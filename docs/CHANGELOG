- replace mke2fs/tune2fs option -O big_journal with -J big
- fix snapshot shrink bug
- record errors messages in journal super block
- clear excluded blocks from COW bitmap
- support disk quotas (not journaled)

v1.0.9
------
Apr 15, 2010
- first public release of next3
- next3 wiki [http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/next3]
- free snapshot blocks when discarding snapshots (tune2fs -O ^has_snapshot)
- cleanup after reboot in the middle of snapshot take
- disable unsupported features: disk quota, data journaling, block size != 4K
- handle partial page write and partial page truncate correctly
- fsck of exclude bitmap

v1.0.8
------
Feb 21, 2010
Bug fixes:
- incorrect cached data in new snapshot (fix COW-read race)
- unused blocks moved to snapshot (fix test COW bitmap blocks count)
- used blocks freed from snapshot (fix shrink blocks count)
Performance:
- fast read of data in new snapshot (copy from cache on COW-read race)
Stability:
- atomic move-on-write hook
- code review by Erez Zadok [http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~ezk]
Sanity tests:
- clean fsck of snapshot image
- trigger f/s error on exclude bitmap in-consistencies
- trigger f/s error if snapshot load fails
- warn on read through of non-allocated block
Compatibility:
- requires e2fsprogs v1.41.9-next3-1.0.8

v1.0.7
------

- cache test_and_cow result in journal_head
- count COW credits in handle
- trace journal transactions and credits status
- implement journal_release
- clean old snapshot files from COW bitmap

v1.0.4
------
Oct 4, 2009
- snapshot merge
- snapshot shrink/merge after file system resize
- disallow snapshot create on a non empty file

v1.0.3
------
Sep 14, 2009
- rebase to kernel 2.6.31
- support for online resize
- reserve disk space for snapshot use
- copy super block to snapshot header
- store snapshot ID in inode generation

v1.0.2
------
Mar 22, 2009
- added "snapshot version" command
- "snapshot start/stop" command calls storage mount/umount, so "snapshot clean/restart" works
  <share-name> must be the same as <volume-name> or storage mount/umount will fail
- "snapshot clean/mkfs" creates a journal of size 2G (smaller file systems are not supported)
- fix journal credits in "snapshot create"

v1.0.1
------
Feb 2, 2009
- After formatting an hard disk and before "snapshot config", reboot is required
- "snapshot config" command takes a 3rd argument <share-name>
  <share-name> is the name given to the share of the root folder of the volume, example:
  # snapshot config /dev/1/vol1 /var/vol/1 public
- After "snapshot config", reboot is required
- Use the command "snapshot take" without the <snapshot-name> argument 
  to create a snapshot named "@GMT-<date>-<time>"
- "@GMT-<date>-<time>" snapshots are viewable via CIFS shadow copies
  (don't forget to run "snapshot mount" after reboot)

v1.0.0
------
Jan 8, 2009
- first beta release
- patch to kernel 2.6.28
- patch to e2fsprogs v1.41.1
