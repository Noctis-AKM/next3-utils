v1.0.0-rc2
----------
Mar 22, 2009
-	added "snapshot version" command
-	"snapshot start/stop" command calls storage mount/umount, so "snapshot clean/restart" works
	<share-name> must be the same as <volume-name> or storage mount/umount will fail
-	"snapshot clean/mkfs" creates a journal of size 2G (smaller file systems are not supported)
-	fix journal credits in "snapshot create"

v1.0.0-rc1
----------
Feb 2, 2009

-	After formatting an hard disk and before "snapshot config", reboot is required
-	"snapshot config" command takes a 3rd argument <share-name>
	<share-name> is the name given to the share of the root folder of the volume, example:
	~ # snapshot config /dev/1/vol1 /var/vol/1 public
-	After "snapshot config", reboot is required
-	Use the command "snapshot take" without the <snapshot-name> argument 
	to create a snapshot named "@GMT-<date>-<time>"
-	"@GMT-<date>-<time>" snapshots are viewable via CIFS shadow copies
	(don't forget to run "snapshot mount" after reboot)
