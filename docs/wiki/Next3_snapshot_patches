==next3_snapshot_debug.patch==

Next3 snapshot debugging support.

To turn snapshot debugging on, run:
"echo N > /sys/kernel/debug/next3/snapshot-debug",
where N is a number between 1 and 5, the higher the number,
the more debugging output is generated.
To turn snapshot debugging off, run:
"echo 0 > /sys/kernel/debug/next3/snapshot-debug".

==next3_snapshot_hooks.patch==

Next3 snapshot hooks.

Insert generic snapshot API calls inside Next3 file system.

===next3_snapshot_hooks_jbd.patch===

Next3 snapshot hooks - inside JBD hooks.

Before every meta data buffer write, the journal API is called,
namely, one of the next3_journal_get_XXX_access() functions.
we use these journal hooks to call the snapshot API,
before every meta data buffer write.

===next3_snapshot_hooks_delete.patch===

Next3 snapshot hooks - delete blocks.

Before deleting file blocks in next3_free_blocks(),
we call the snapshot API snapshot_get_delete_access(),
to optionally move the block to the snapshot file.

===next3_snapshot_hooks_data.patch===

Next3 snapshot hooks - move data blocks.

Before every regular file data buffer write,
the function next3_get_block() is called to map the buffer to disk.
we use this hook to call the snapshot API snapshot_get_move_access(),
to optionally move the block to the snapshot file.

==next3_snapshot_file.patch==

Next3 snapshot file.

Next3 snapshot implementation as a file inside the file system.
Snapshot files are marked with the snapfile flag and have special
read-only aops.

===next3_snapshot_file_peep.patch===

Next3 snapshot file - read through to block device.

On active snapshot file page read, the function next3_get_block()
is called to map the page to a disk block.  If the page is not mapped
in the snapshot file a direct mapping to the block device is returned.

===next3_snapshot_file_perm.patch===

Next3 snapshot file - permissions.

Enforce snapshot file permissions.
Write truncate and unlink of snapshot inodes is not allowed.

===next3_snapshot_file_store.patch===

Next3 snapshot file - store on disk.

Snapshot inode is stored differently in memory and on disk.
During store and load of snapshot inode, some of the inode flags
and fields are converted.

==next3_snapshot_block.patch==

Next3 snapshot block operations.

Core implementation of special snapshot file block operations.
The argument @create to the function next3_get_blocks_handle()
is re-interpreted as a snapshot block command argument.  The old
argument values 0(=read) and 1(=create) preserve the original
behavior of the function.  The bit field h_cowing in the current
transaction handle is used to prevent COW recursions.

===next3_snapshot_block_cow.patch===

Next3 snapshot block operation - copy blocks to snapshot.

Imeplementation of copying blocks into a snapshot file.
This mechanism is used to copy-on-write metadata blocks to snapshot.

===next3_snapshot_block_bitmap.patch===

Next3 snapshot block operation - copy block bitmap to snapshot.

The snapshot copy of the file system block bitmap is called the COW
bitmap and it is used to check if a block was allocated at the time
that the snapshot was taken.

===next3_snapshot_block_move.patch===

Next3 snapshot block operation - move blocks to snapshot.

Imeplementation of moving blocks into a snapshot file.
The move block command maps an allocated blocks to the snapshot file,
allocating only the indirect blocks when needed.
This mechanism is used to move-on-write data blocks to snapshot.

==next3_snapshot_ctl.patch==

Next3 snapshot control.

Snapshot control with chattr -X.
Take/delete snapshot with chattr -X +/-S.
Enable/disable snapshot with chattr -X +/-n.

===next3_snapshot_ctl_init.patch===

Next3 snapshot control - init new snapshot.

On snapshot create, a few special blocks (i.e. the super block and
group descriptors) are pre-allocated and on snapshot take, they are
copied under journal_lock_updates().  This is done to avoid the
recursion that would be caused by COWing these blocks after the
snapshot becomes active.

===next3_snapshot_ctl_fix.patch===

Next3 snapshot control - fix new snapshot.

On snapshot take, after copying the pre-allocated blocks, some are
fixed to make the snapshot image appear as a valid Ext2 file system.

===next3_snapshot_ctl_reserve.patch===

Next3 snapshot control - reserve disk space for snapshot.

Ensure there is enough disk space for snapshot file future use.
Reserve disk space on snapshot take based on file system overhead
size, number of directories and number of blocks/inodes in use.

===next3_snapshot_ctl_dump.patch===

Next3 snapshot control - dump snapshot file blocks map.

Use chattr -d to print the blocks map of a snapshot file.
Snapshot debugging should be enabled.

==next3_snapshot_journal.patch==

Next3 snapshot journaled.

Next3 snapshot operations are journaled inside the same transaction
with the file system operation that triggered them.

===next3_snapshot_journal_error.patch===

Next3 snapshot journaled - record journal error.

Snapshot errors are recorded as journal errors.
Next3 should be mounted with errors=remount-ro.
After a snapshot error, the file system will be in read-only mode.
The administrator must un-mount the file system and run fsck
to prevent data corruption.
Some places in Ext3 original code don't check for return value of
JBD functions.  Check for snapshot/journal errors in those places.

===next3_snapshot_journal_credits.patch===

Next3 snapshot journaled - increase transaction credits.

Snapshot operations are journaled as part of the running transaction.
The amount of requested credits is multiplied with a factor, to ensure
that enough buffer credits are reserved in the running transaction.

===next3_snapshot_journal_release.patch===

Next3 snapshot journaled - implement journal_release_buffer().

journal_release_buffer() is called to cancel a previous call
to journal_get_write_access() and to recall the used buffer credit.
Current implementation of journal_release_buffer() in JBD is empty,
since no buffer credtis are used until the buffer is marked dirty.
However, because resulting snapshot COW operation cannot be undone,
we try to extend the current transaction to compensate for the used
credits of the extra COW operation, so we don't run out of buffer
credits too soon.

===next3_snapshot_journal_bypass.patch===

Next3 snapshot journaled - bypass to save credits.

Don't journal COW bitmap indirect blocks to save journal credits.

===next3_snapshot_journal_cache.patch===

Next3 snapshot journaled - cache last COW tid in journal_head.

Cache last COW transaction id in buffer's journal_head.
the cache supresses COW tests until the transaction in committed,
which implies an avarage cache expiry of 2.5 seconds.
Before taking a new snapshot, the journal is flushed to disk
and the current transaction in commited, so the COW cache is
invalidated (as it should be).

===next3_snapshot_journal_trace.patch===

Next3 snapshot journaled - trace COW/buffer credits.

Extra debug prints to trace snapshot usage of buffer credits.

==next3_snapshot_list.patch==

Next3 snapshot list support.

Implementation of multiple incremental snapshots.
Snapshot inodes are chained on a list starting at the super block,
both on-disk and in-memory, similar to the orhpan inodes.  We reuse
the orphan inode list functions to manipulate the snapshot list.
Unlink and truncate of snapshot inodes on the list is not allowed,
so an inode can never be chained on both orphan and snapshot lists.
We makes use of this fact to overload the in-memory inode field
next3_inode_info.i_orphan for the chaining of snapshots.

===next3_snapshot_list_peep.patch===

Next3 snapshot list - read through to previous snapshot.

On snapshot page read, the function next3_get_block() is called
to map the page to a disk block.  If the page is not mapped in the
snapshot file, the previous snapshots on the list are checked.
The first found mapping is returned.

==next3_snapshot_race.patch==

Next3 snapshot race conditions.

Resolve snapshot race conditions

===next3_snapshot_race_bitmap.patch===

Next3 snapshot race conditions - concurrent COW bitmap operations.

Wait for pending COW bitmap creations to complete.
When concurrent tasks try to COW buffers from the same block group
for the first time, the first task to reset the COW bitmap cache
is elected to create the new COW bitmap block.
The rest of the tasks wait until the COW bitmap cache is uptodate.
The COWing task copies the bitmap block into the new COW bitmap block
and updates the COW bitmap cache with the new block number.

===next3_snapshot_race_cow.patch===

Next3 snapshot race conditions - concurrent COW operations.

Wait for pending COW operations to complete.
When concurrent tasks try to COW the same buffer, the task that takes
the active snapshot trucate_mutex is elected as the the COWing task.
The COWing task allocates a new snapshot block and creates a buffer
cache entry with ref_count=1 for that new block.  It then locks the
new buffer and marks it with the buffer_new flag.  The rest of the
tasks, find the 'new' buffer in the buffer cache and have to wait
until the buffer_new flag is cleared.  The COWing task copies the
source buffer into the 'new' buffer, unlocks it, marks it as journal
dirty data, clears the new_buffer flag and drops its reference count.
On active snapshot readpage, the buffer cache is checked.
If a 'new' buffer entry is found, the reader task waits until the
buffer_new flag is cleared and then copies the 'new' buffer directly
into the snapshot file page.

===next3_snapshot_race_read.patch===

Next3 snapshot race conditions - tracked reads.

Wait for pending read I/O requests to complete.
When a snapshot file readpage reads through to the block device,
the snapshot page buffer is added to the block tracked readers.
Upon completion of the async read I/O request of the snapshot page,
the page buffer is removed from the block tracked readers.
When a block is being COWed, all of its tracked readers
have to remove themselves before the COW operation is completed.

==next3_snapshot_exclude.patch==

Next3 snapshot exclude.

Mark all snapshot blocks excluded.
Excluding snapshot file blocks is essential for efficient cleanup
of deleted snapshot files.

===next3_snapshot_exclude_inode.patch===

Next3 snapshot exclude - the exclude inode.

The exclude inode owns all the exclude bitmap blocks.
The exclude inode is pre-allocated by 'tune2fs -O exclude_inode'.
The location of exclude bitmap blocks is read on mount time and cached
in the group descriptors.  The exclude inode is extended on online and
offline resize operations when block groups are added.

===next3_snapshot_exclude_bitmap.patch===

Next3 snapshot exclude - the exclude bitmap.

Excluding blocks is done by setting their bit in the exclude bitmap.
There is one exclude bitmap block per block group and it's location
is cached in the group descriptor.

==next3_snapshot_cleanup.patch==

Next3 snapshot cleanup.

Cleanup snapshots list and reclaim unused blocks of deleted snapshots.
Oldest snapshot can be removed from list and it's blocks can be freed.
Non-oldest snapshots have to be shrunk and merged before they can be
removed from the list.  All snapshot blocks must be excluded in order
to properly shrink/merge deleted old snapshots.

===next3_snapshot_cleanup_shrink.patch===

Next3 snapshot cleanup - shrink deleted snapshots.

Free blocks of deleted snapshots, which are not in use by an older
non-deleted snapshot.  Shrinking helps reclaiming disk space
while older snapshots are currently in use (enabled).

===next3_snapshot_cleanup_merge.patch===

Next3 snapshot cleanup - merge shrunk snapshots.

Move blocks of deleted and shrunk snapshots to an older non-deleted
and disabled snapshot.  Merging helps removing snapshots from list
while older snapshots are not currently in use (disabled).
