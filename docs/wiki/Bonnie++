Bonnie++ is a benchmark tool for measuring file I/O performance. We used Bonnie++ to verify the following assumptions about Next3 vs. Ext3 write performance:
# Next3 write performance should be equivalent to Ext3 performance when there are no snapshots
# Next3 generates some synchronic read/write I/O requests after a new snapshot is taken
# Next3 generates a-synchronic write I/O requests when writing blocks that are included in a snapshot

The benchmarks where run in the following variations to test the assumptions above:
* EXT3+W+RW: write a 1G file to empty Ext3, re-write 1G
* NEXT3+W+RW: write a 1G file to empty Next3, re-write 1G
* NEXT3+S+W+RW: take a new snapshot of empty Next3, write a 1G file, re-write 1G
* NEXT3-S+W+RW: keep old snapshot of empty Next3, write a 1G file, re-write 1G
* NEXT3+W+S+RW: write a 1G file to empty Next3, take a snapshot, re-write 1G

=== Benchmark tests over NFS ===
These benchmark tests were run over NFS.

The client was an X86 machine with 8MB RAM and the server was an ARM machine with 512MB RAM.
The %CPU and Sequential Input results are irrelevant in this setup.

The results verify the assumptions we have made about Next3 vs. Ext3 write performance:
# Next3 w/o snapshots (NEXT3+W+RW) performs similar to Ext3 (EXT3+W+RW)
# Next3 with old snapshot (NEXT3-S+W+RW) performs similar to Next3 w/o snapshots (NEXT3+W+RW) and better than Next3 with new snapshot (NEXT3+S+W+RW)
# Re-write of file whose blocks are included in a snapshot (NEXT3+W+S+RW) is slower than re-write of file whose blocks are not included in a snapshot (NEXT3+S+W+RW)
