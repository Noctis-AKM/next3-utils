Next3 source package is available for download on the project [http://sourceforge.net/projects/next3/files/ download page].
The package next3-1.0.y.tar.gz consists of the following components. 

==linux-2.6.x.y-next3_fs.patch==
Adds a cloned Next3 file system to the kernel (cloned from Ext3 in kernel 2.6.x.y, but may be applied to other kernels as well).
This patch is not dependent on the Next3 release version.

==next3_snapshot-1.0.y.patch==
Adds snapshot support to a fresh Next3 clone. Also available as a patch series ([[Next3 snapshot patches]]).

==e2fsprogs-1.41.x-next3-1.0.y.patch==
Adds snapshot awareness to e2fsck, mke2fs, dumpe2fs, debugfs, resize2fs, tune2fs, lsattr and chattr.

There are no snapshot COW operations during offline processing, only restrictions on changing a file system with snapshots offline.

==next3 script==
The next3 script uses patched e2fsprogs utils to manage next3 snapshots and run snapshot tests.
