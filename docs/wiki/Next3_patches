Next3 package release version is noted by 1.0.y and it consists of the following components,
which will be available for download on the project page soon. 

==linux-2.6.x.y-next3_fs.patch==
Adds a cloned Next3 file system to the kernel (cloned from Ext3 in kernel 2.6.x.y, but may be applied to other kernels as well).
This patch is not dependent on the Next3 release version.

==next3_snapshot-1.0.y.patch==
Adds snapshot support to a fresh Next3 clone. Also available as a patch series ([[Next3 snapshot patches]]).

==e2fsprogs-1.41.x-next3-1.0.y.patch==
Adds snapshot awareness to e2fsck, mke2fs, dumpe2fs, debugfs, resize2fs, tune2fs, lsattr and chattr.

There are no snapshot COW operations during offline processing, only restrictions on changing a file system with snapshots offline.

==snapshot script==
The snapshot script uses patched e2fsprogs utils to manage Next3 snapshots and run snapshot tests.
