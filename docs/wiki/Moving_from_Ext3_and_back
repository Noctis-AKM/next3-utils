Next3 is fully compatible with Ext3, because it doesn't change on-disk format, so no conversion or migration are needed when moving from Ext3 to Next3 and back.

==The on-disk differences between Next3 and Ext3==
* Next3 uses snapshot files, which appear as regular sparse files to Ext3 and e2fsprogs.
* Next3 uses some reserved fields in the on-disk super block and in the on-disk inode structs of the snapshot files.
* Next3 requires a bigger journal (2GB) for best concurrent writers performance.
* Next3 requires the special "exclude" inode for best disk space reclamation from deleted snapshots.

==Moving from Ext3 to Next3==
Basically, any Ext3 volume can be mounted as Next3 (i.e., mount -t next3 /dev/xxx).
However, for best snapshots performance, a patched tune2fs should be used to increase the journal size and to allocate the special "exclude" inode before mounting an Ext3 volume as Next3. For example:

<pre>
# Remove the journal
tune2fs -O ^has_journal /dev/xxx

# Create a big journal and allocate exclude inode
tune2fs -O has_journal,big_journal,exclude_inode /dev/xxx
</pre>

Note that the "big_journal" and "exclude_inode" features are compatible with Ext3, so there is no need to remove them when moving from Next3 back to Ext3. Also, an Ext3 volume can be formatted to be Next3 ready. For Example:

<pre>
# Format an Ext3 file system with big journal and exclude inode
mke2fs -j -O big_journal,exclude_inode /dev/xxx
</pre>

==Moving from Next3 to Ext3==
Before snapshots are taken in Next3, the volume can be mounted as Ext3 or as Next3.

When the first snapshot is taken, Next3 sets the read-only-compatible file system feature "has_snapshot",
to prevent Ext3 and un-patched e2fsprogs from changing the file system without updating the snapshot.

A Next3 volume with snapshots can be mounted as Next3 or as read-only Ext3 (i.e., mount -r -t ext3 /dev/xxx).
When using the mount command without specifying the file system implicitly (i.e., mount /dev/xxx), a volume with the "has_snapshot" feature will be automatically  mounted as Next3.

To move back to Ext3, a patched tune2fs should be used to truncate all snapshot files and clear the "has_snapshot" feature. For Example:

<pre>
# Discard all snapshots
tune2fs -O ^has_snapshot /dev/xxx
</pre>
