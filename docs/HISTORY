Next3 development history

What is Next3?
Next3 is a clone of the Ext3 file system with the addition of snapshot support

What is this file?
this HISTORY file is an attempt to serialized the next3 sub patches.
it aims to help developers follow the changes from ext3 to next3
by following the changes in the order they should be applied
(which is not always the order that they were developed).
the sub patches are represented by the snapshot categories defined in Kconfig.
for a complete list snapshot patch categories see the auto generated index file.


Next3 top-level patches:

next3_fs.patch - adds the next3 file system (fresh ext3 clone) to the kernel (NEXT3_FS)
next3_snapshot.patch - adds snapshot support to a fresh ext3 clone (NEXT3_FS_SNAPSHOT)
e2fsprogs_snapshot.patch - adds next3 features to e2fsck resize2fs tune2fs lsattr and chattr


Next3 snapshot applied sub patches:

CONFIG_NEXT3_FS_SNAPSHOT_BLOCK - snapshot file block operations
CONFIG_NEXT3_FS_SNAPSHOT_CTL - snapshot management code (added snapshot_ctl.c)
CONFIG_NEXT3_FS_SNAPSHOT_HOOKS - define snapshot hooks API
/* checkpoint: snapshot framework and API */

CONFIG_NEXT3_FS_SNAPSHOT_FILE_PEEP - peep through from active snapshot to block device 
/* checkpoint: single empty snapshot create/delete/mount via loop device */

CONFIG_NEXT3_FS_SNAPSHOT_JOURNAL_CREDITS - increase transaction credits 
CONFIG_NEXT3_FS_SNAPSHOT_HOOKS_JBD - snapshot metadata hooks inside JBD hooks 
CONFIG_NEXT3_FS_SNAPSHOT_HOOKS_INODE - pass inode in snapshot hooks to identify snapshot file updates
/* checkpoint: snapshot is proof to metadata changes (creat/rename/mkdir) */

CONFIG_NEXT3_FS_SNAPSHOT_BLOCK_MOVE - remap allocated blocks to snapshot file
CONFIG_NEXT3_FS_SNAPSHOT_HOOKS_MOVE - move data blocks to active snapshot on write_begin()
/* checkpoint: snapshot is proof to data changes (overwrite/append) */

CONFIG_NEXT3_FS_SNAPSHOT_HOOKS_DELETE - move blocks to active snapshot on free_blocks()
/* checkpoint: snapshot is proof to deletes (truncate/remove/rmdir) */

/* 
 * mile stone: functional single snapshot 
 * constrains: 
 * - single snapshot reader or file system writer at a time
 * - enough free disk space for snapshot metadata
 */

CONFIG_NEXT3_FS_SNAPSHOT_LIST - snapshots list implementation
CONFIG_NEXT3_FS_SNAPSHOT_LIST_PEEP - peep through to previous snapshot on list
/* checkpoint: multiple snapshots create/delete last/mount via loop device */

/* 
 * mile stone: functional multiple snapshots
 * constrains: 
 * - single snapshot reader or file system writer at a time
 * - enough free disk space for snapshot metadata
 * - only oldest snapshot can be deleted
 */

CONFIG_NEXT3_FS_SNAPSHOT_JOURNAL_ERROR - check return value of JBD hooks (posted to ext4-devel)
/* checkpoint: handle unexpected out of disk space errors due to COW operation */

CONFIG_NEXT3_FS_SNAPSHOT_JOURNAL_RELEASE - check remaining COW credits on journal_release_buffer() 
CONFIG_NEXT3_FS_SNAPSHOT_JOURNAL_BYPASS - bypass journal on COW bitmap operation to save credits 
CONFIG_NEXT3_FS_SNAPSHOT_JOURNAL_CACHE - cache buffer COW state in running transaction
CONFIG_NEXT3_FS_SNAPSHOT_JOURNAL_TRACE - trace remaining COW/buffer credits and COW statistics 
/* checkpoint: avoid out of buffer credits oops due to COW operation (warn on low COW credits) */

CONFIG_NEXT3_FS_SNAPSHOT_BALLOC_RESERVE - reserve disk space for snapshot metadata
/* checkpoint: avoid unexpected out of disk space errors due to COW operation */

CONFIG_NEXT3_FS_SNAPSHOT_RACE_BITMAP - resolve race conditions on pending COW bitmap operations 
/* checkpoint: test concurrent bitmap COW operations with test-bitmap-delay-msec */

CONFIG_NEXT3_FS_SNAPSHOT_RACE_COW - resolve race conditions on pending COW operations 
/* checkpoint: test concurrent COW operations with test-cow-delay-msec */

CONFIG_BLOCK_TRACKED_READ - adds tracked read support to buffered I/O
CONFIG_NEXT3_FS_SNAPSHOT_RACE_READ - resolve race conditions on pending active snapshot read through 
/* checkpoint: test COW during pending read through with test-read-delay-msec */

/* 
 * mile stone: stable multiple snapshots
 * constrains: 
 * - only oldest snapshot can be deleted
 */

CONFIG_NEXT3_FS_SNAPSHOT_EXCLUDE_INODE - read exclude bitmap blocks from exclude inode (allocate on resize)
CONFIG_NEXT3_FS_SNAPSHOT_EXCLUDE_BITMAP - update exclude bitmap on snapshot block allocate/move/delete
CONFIG_NEXT3_FS_SNAPSHOT_CLEANUP - cleanup snapshots list from deleted snapshots
CONFIG_NEXT3_FS_SNAPSHOT_CLEANUP_SHRINK - free unused blocks of deleted snapshots
CONFIG_NEXT3_FS_SNAPSHOT_CLEANUP_MERGE - move deleted snapshot blocks to older non-deleted snapshot

/* 
 * mile stone: multiple deletable snapshots
 * constrains: 
 * - exclude inode needs to be pre-allocated before taking snapshots
 *     otherwise, some unused blocks may not be reclaimed on shrink/merge
 * - unused blocks of deleted active snapshot are reclaimed after:
 *     a new snapshot becomes active (shrink/merge)
 *   or 
 *     all snapshots have been deleted (cleanup)
 * - deleted snapshots are removed from the list after:
 *     all older snapshots have been disabled (merge)
 *   or 
 *     all older snapshots have been deleted (cleanup)
 */


Next3 snapshot unapplied sub patches:

CONFIG_NEXT3_FS_SNAPSHOT_BALLOC_GOAL - special block allocation strategy for snapshot files
CONFIG_NEXT3_FS_SNAPSHOT_EXCLUDE_FILES - exclude any file with the NODUMP flag (chattr +d)
