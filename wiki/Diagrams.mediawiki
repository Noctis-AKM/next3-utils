The Diagrams in this page explain the differences between block write operations in Ext3 and Next3.

For the example, an arbitrary value of 2TB was selected as the file system size. The same value is imposed as the active snapshot sparse file size.

Next3 uses a bigger default journal size (3GB) than Ext3 default journal size (128MB), to accommodate the active snapshot metadata in the block write transaction.

=Ext3 block write=
The Diagrams in this section depict the interaction between Ext3 and the journal block device (JBD) on write of metadata block and data block (in data=ordered mode).

==Metadata block journaled write with Ext3+JBD==
Before writing a metadata block, the get_write_access() JBD API is called to add the buffer to the transaction.

==Data block ordered write with Ext3+JBD==
Before writing a data page, the get_block() callback is called to start a transaction and to allocate missing inode blocks.

=Next3 block write=
The Diagrams in this section depict the interaction between Next3, the active snapshot file and the journal block device (JBD) on write of metadata block and data block (in data=ordered mode).

==Metadata block copy-on-write with Next3+Snapshot+JBD==
Before writing a metadata block, the get_write_access() Snapshot API is called to copy the block to the active snapshot.

==Data block move-on-write with Next3+Snapshot+JBD==
Before writing a data page, the get_block() callback is called to move the data block to the active snapshot and to allocate a new data block.
