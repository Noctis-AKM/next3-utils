= Ext4 snapshots design challenges =
The following issues require special attention when merging the snapshots
feature to ext4.

Ext4 developers are encouraged to comment on these issues and suggest
solutions other than the ones proposed here.

== Extent mapped file data block re-write ==
The term re-write refers to a non first write to a file's data block.
The first write allocates a new block for that file and requires no special
snapshot block operations. If a snapshot was taken after a block was
allocated, that block is protected by the snapshot's COW bitmap. Any attempt
to re-write that block should result in a snapshot block operation, which
either copies the original data to the snapshot file or moves the original
block to the snapshot file and allocates a new block for the new data.

Current implementation moves data blocks of indirect mapped files to
snapshot on re-write. The move-on-write method is more efficient than the
copy-on-write method, but it may cause a file to get fragmented in a use
case of re-writes to many random locations.

For extent mapped files re-write, there are 2 possible solutions.
Ted T'so has wrote about this choice:

''Technically speaking, it's possible to do it both ways, yes?''
''I'm not sure why you consider this such an important design decision.''
''We can even play games where for some files we might do copy-on-write,''
''and for some files, we do move-on-write. It's always possible to check''
''the COW bitmaps to decide what had happened.''

=== Move-on-write ===
Besides the mentioned file fragmentation problem, every move-on-write
operation may need to split up a data extent into 2 extents of existing
blocks and a third extent for blocks allocated for the new data.
The metadata overhead of such a split operation is more significant than
that of an indirect mapped file move-on-write operation and these extra
metadata updates will have to be accounted for in advance when starting a
block re-write transaction. Extent spliting may also degrade re-write
performance to extent mapped files.

In general, delayed allocation, or delayed move-on-write for our purpose,
should be used to avoid extent splitting as much as possible.

Perhaps the file fragmentation problem can be solved by online
de-fragmentation. After all, the original file's blocks are kept safely
inside the snapshot file, so a background task can simply copy the snapshot
moved blocks to new locations and then copy the file's new data into its
original blocks and map them back into the file.

=== Copy-on-write ===
Copying the re-written block to snapshot may seem like the "easy way out"
of the file fragmentation problem, but the problems it causes in return
are not to be disregarded.

The first and obvious problem is write performance, because every data
block re-write involves reading the content of the existing block from
storage, before proceeding with the re-write. This read I/O can be avoided
when using the move-on-write method. Though the write performance seems
like a big limitation, it can be tagged as a trade-off between random write
performance and sequential read performance and the choice can be left at
the hands of the user.

The second issue with data blocks copy-on-write is the snapshot reserved
blocks count. On snapshot take, the file system reserves a certain amount of
blocks for snapshot use. The reservation is calculated from the estimated
count of metadata blocks that may need to be copied to snapshot at some
point in the future. Move-on-write uses much less snapshot reserved blocks
than copy-on-write, so the data blocks count doesn't need to be accounted
for. When choosing to do copy-on-write on data blocks re-write, the re-write
operation should first verify that there is enough disk space for allocating
the snapshot copied data blocks without using snapshot reserved blocks.
If there is not enough disk space, the operation should return ENOSPC.

The last and most challenging issue has to do with I/O ordering within a
single snapshot COW operation. The rule is very simple:
To keep the snapshot data safe, the snapshot copy has to secured in storage
before the new data is allowed to be written to storage.

With metadata copy-on-write, this ordering is provided as a by product from
the journaling sub-system. All snapshot COW'ed blocks are marked as ordered
data, which is always written to storage before transaction commit starts
and metadata blocks are always written to storage during transaction commit.

When COW'ing a data block, which may be "ordered" or "writeback", there is
no mechanism in place to help order the async writes of the snapshot COW'ed
blocks before the async writes of the re-written data blocks. Even worse,
when COW'ing an "ordered" data block, the journal will force it to storage
before transaction commit starts and the snapshot COW'ed block mapping into
the snapshot file will only be written during transaction commit.

One possible solution is to implement a "holdback" list of blocks that
should not be written before the current transaction commits. Naturally, a
block must not be on both the "ordered" and "holdback" lists, but when
re-writing an allocated data block, there is no sense in making this block
"ordered", because this kind of data modification is directly related to any
metadata modification (except change of inode's mtime, but who cares).

=== Heal-on-rewrite ===
Copy and move on write both have severe performance implications.
One idea that can enjoy the best of the two methods, is heal-on-rewrite.

The first time a snapshot protected data block is written, it is moved to
snapshot, possibly fragmenting the file (if it is a random write pattern).

At that time, a self-healing I/O sequence is initiated, in which the data
in the old file block, which is currently mapped to the snapshot file, is
copied to a new block and remapped to the snapshot file. The old block is
then freed and inserted to the original file's preallocations.

The seconds time that data is written to the same offset, the file will be
automatically de-fragmented, using the new data will be written to the
good old block.

The seconds time write can either be initiated after the snapshot remapping
is complete or it can rely on the assumption that "random" write patterns
are not really random and that writing to offset X in a file is unlikely a
singular event. So at some point in time a file may be fragmented, but at
a later time it will be healed, preserving a constant level of fragmentation
over time.

==Large file create and delete performance==
Ext4 has improved performance over Ext3 mainly due to delayed allocation and extent mapped files.

Delayed allocation improves performance by reducing I/O flush requests and by helping to allocate
large extents of data blocks when creating large files.

Extent mapped files improve performance by reducing the metadata write overhead when creating and deleting
large files.

On first look, delayed allocation should not interfere with snapshots and vise versa,
so the performance of creating large file should not be affected by snapshots.
This statement needs to be investigated and verified.

One thing that does require attention with delayed allocation is the size of the blocks reservation
made when re-writing into an already allocated data extent of size N.
Without snapshots, there is no need for any reservation. With snapshots, there may be a need to reserve up to
N new blocks for the re-write, depending on the snapshot's COW bitmap.

The performance of deleting large file, however, will be affected by snapshots.
The question is how much? A special effort should be invested in optimizing the deletion
of large data extents with snapshots enabled.

One possible solution would be to use extent mapped snapshot files and to move the entire deleted extent
to the snapshot file with significantly fewer metadata I/O operations than when moving deleted blocks
into an indirect mapped snapshot file.

==Large file system size (64bit support)==
Ext3 file system size is limited by 32bit physical block address space.

Ext4 breaks this limit by using 48bit physical block address space in extent mapped files.

Snapshot files are used to map the entire file system block address space.
The current snapshot file format is an extended indirect mapped file,
with up to 4 triple indirect blocks, that can map a 32bit block address space
when the file system block size is 4K.

Even if the snapshot file format would be an extent mapped file, it wouldn't be possible 
to map a 48bit block address space, because extent mapped files have a 32bit logical block address space.

In order to map a 48bit physical block address space, the snapshot file would have to use a new
extent format, which maps a 48bit logical address space to a 48bit physical address space.

==Large scale SMP systems==
In general, every file system should aim to allow as many concurrent operations as possible on both single and multiple CPU systems.
In many cases, file system operations on different objects (i.e. inodes) or on different physical locations (i.e. block groups) can be performed concurrently with very little need for synchronization.

With current snapshots implementation, however, every COW operation of any block in the file system needs to acquire a write lock (the active snapshot file's i_data_sem).
One must keep in mind that COW operations are not so common and one might think. New allocated blocks are never COW'ed and COW of modified metadata block happens only once per snapshot era.

To mitigate the COW bottleneck, taking the write lock can be avoided, thanks to the restriction that the active snapshot cannot be truncated nor unlinked.

Instead, the synchronization of concurrent COW operations can be achieved by taking the buffer_head spin lock before splicing a new branch to the indirect map tree.
If a branch was already slices to the slice point, the new allocated branch is pruned and sliced at a deeper level of the existing branch.

This solution is unique to the indirect map format, because extent map format may need to re-balance the entire tree on every allocation.

Thanks for Jan Kara for helping me to come up with this solution , which was designed on a napkin in ksummit ;-).

==The (ab?)use of page cache==
As all other metadata operations, the file system uses the block device's page cache, with attached buffer heads,
to perform the I/O of COW operations.

During COW operations, those buffer heads are used to synchronize concurrent COW and snapshot reading tasks.
For the sake of simplifying the code dealing with race conditions, a task reading through from a snapshot file to
block device, first grabs the block device's associated page.

The result is that many snapshot file readpage operations end up using 2 pages instead of just one (the block device's page for synchronization and the snapshot file's page for the actual read). Further more, when reading the same file system block from several different snapshots, there is one page used per snapshots. Since all those pages read the same block, this is a waste of memory and a waste of I/O.

On top of that, the loop block device associated with the snapshot file has cached pages of it's own.

A possible solution to all this waste of pages, would be that the file system should expose virtual read-only block devices instead of using loop block devices on snapshot files. The virtual block device could possibly share pages amongst themselves (it this possible?) and in any case, the waste of the snapshot file pages would be avoided.
